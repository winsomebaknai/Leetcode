2215. Find the difference of two array
Given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return a list answer of size 2 where:

answer[0] is a list of all distinct integers in nums1 which are not present in nums2.
answer[1] is a list of all distinct integers in nums2 which are not present in nums1.
Note that the integers in the lists may be returned in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4,6]
Output: [[1,3],[4,6]]
Explanation:
For nums1, nums1[1] = 2 is present at index 0 of nums2, whereas nums1[0] = 1 and nums1[2] = 3 are not present in nums2. Therefore, answer[0] = [1,3].
For nums2, nums2[0] = 2 is present at index 1 of nums1, whereas nums2[1] = 4 and nums2[2] = 6 are not present in nums2. Therefore, answer[1] = [4,6].

class Solution:
    def findDifference(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        set1 = set(nums1)
        set2 = set(nums2)

        result1 = set()
        result2 = set()

        for n in nums1:
            if n not in set2:
                result1.add(n)
        
        for n in nums2:
            if n not in nums1:
                result2.add(n)



        return [list(result1), list(result2)]
